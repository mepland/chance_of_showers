## Installing Dependencies
It is recommended to work in a [python virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to avoid clashes with other installed software. If you do not wish to use a virtual environment you can usually just run the first few cells of the notebook in question - useful when running on cloud-based virtual machines.
```bash
python -m venv ~/.venvs/daq
source ~/.venvs/daq/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
